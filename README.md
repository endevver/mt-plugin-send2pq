# Send to Publish Queue plugin for Movable Type

This plugin provides administrators with the ability to republish a blog
through the Publish Queue. Send to Publish Queue can be used to republish one
or many blogs:

* Visit System Overview > Blogs, or go to a website and choose the Blogs menu
  item. Select the blogs you'd like republished, and choose "Send to Publish
  Queue" from the List Actions.
* Visit Design > Templates and choose the Action "Send to Publish Queue."

The plugin will send every template to the Publish Queue to be published later.
Once the publishing job is complete, another cleanup task will go through and
email the specified parties.
